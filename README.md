# üêç Snake Game (Python, Turtle, OOP)

This project is a modern, event-driven, **Object-Oriented** implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python‚Äôs `turtle` graphics.  

It follows **OOP best practices**:  
- **Data Abstraction**: Game logic is encapsulated in classes (`Snake`, `Food`, `Scoreboard`, `Game`).  
- **Encapsulation & Information Hiding**: Internal state is private (`_attributes`), exposed only via properties/methods.  
- **Pythonic getters/setters**: Read-only access is provided via `@property` (e.g. `snake.head`, `food.position`), instead of explicit getters and setters.

## üìÇ Modules Overview

- **`snake.py`** ‚Üí Snake body, movement, growth, collision detection.  
- **`food.py`** ‚Üí Food item that spawns randomly.  
- **`scoreboard.py`** ‚Üí Score tracking and game over messages (with blinking text).  
- **`game.py`** ‚Üí Orchestrates the game: screen setup, loop, event handling.  
- **`main.py`** ‚Üí Entry point (launches the game).

## State Diagram ‚Äì Gameplay Lifecycle

    [*] --> Running : Game starts

    Running --> Paused : Snake hits wall or self
    Paused --> Running : Player presses any key (restart)

    Running --> Running : Snake eats food / moves
    Paused --> [*] : Player closes window
